## Instructions

 Step 1.  Download this repository.  You can clone it with GitHub's tools.

 Step 2.  Download and install RStudio.

https://www.rstudio.com/

 Step 3.  Open RStudio, and install the knitr package.  Do this by clicking _Packages_ tab, then click the _Install Packages_ button.  Search for "knitr", make sure _Install dependencies_ is checked, and click _Install_.

 Step 4.  Enable knitr in RStudio.  Do this by clicking _Preferences_, then clicking the _Sweave_ tab.  Next to "Weave Rnw files using", select knitr from the drop-down menu.  Click _Apply_ and _Ok_.

 Step 5.  Open the ANC markdown source document, "Medic_Mobile_ANC_worksheet.Rmd", in RStudio.

 Step 6.  In Rstudio, compile and execute the ANC knitr document by clicking the _Knit HTML_.  You should see a window pop up that shows the formatted version of the markdown document.  This is the "Preview HTML" window.  Read through this document carefully and follow the instructions.  It will require you to switch between itself, the markdown source in RStudio, and Spectrum.  Whenever you make a change in the markdown source document in RStudio, make sure to save it and then click the refresh icon in the "Preview HTML" window (it's a typical refresh arrow circle).  This is a living document that computes statistics you need to do the projections on the fly.
