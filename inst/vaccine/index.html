Medic Mobile Vaccine Effectiveness Worksheet
========================================

# Synopsis

The purpose of this worksheet is to estimate the effectiveness of
childhood vaccination programs on a population.

# Instructions

Every time you see a sentence in boldface, go to the R markdown source
document and enter the requested value.

# Software Versions Tested

* Mac OS X Mavericks
* Wine 1.6.1, packaged with WineBottler
* Spectrum 4.7, includes LiST, DemProj and AIM
* RStudio 0.98 with knitr 1.5

# Preparation

**What is the name of the country?**

```{r}
country.name <- "Kenya"
```

**What is the first year you will be modeling an increase in vaccine
coverage?  Must be the current year or later.**

```{r}
first.anc.year <- 2015
```

**How many children will the program serve in `r first.anc.year`?**

```{r}
n.child.covered <- 5000
```

You are embarking on vaccine projection for `r country.name`. The year
you want to model an increase in coverage is `r first.anc.year`.

# Initialize Spectrum

Launch Spectrum.  (If this is your first time, proceed to the next
step now.  If this is not your first time, make sure all your previous
projection are closed: in the _Home_ tab, select _Close &rarr; All
Projections_.)

Click _New_ or _New projection_.

![title](/ocpu/library/MedicMobileImpact/vaccine/images/Spectrum_first_screen.png)

In the _New_ dialog, under “Set a name...”, set the name for this
projection.  Make it descriptive of the country, locale and
intervention.

Under “Set year boundaries...”, enter a first year that is at least a
full year before the start of the intervention.

Set the final year to 10 years after the start year.

In the “Activate modules for use in your projection” area, check the
following three boxes.

1. _Demographic Projection (DemProj)_
1. _AIDS (AIM)_
1. _Lives Saved Tool (LiST)_

In the “Select a country from which to retrieve demographic and other
default data”, click _Country data_ and select the country
corresponding to 1b.  Make sure DemProj, AIM, and LiST are checked
(they should already be).

Click _Ok_. 

# Determine Children in Country

Click on the _Modules_ tab in the main window.

Click on the _DemProj_ module.

Select _Results &rarr; Age Groups &rarr; All Age Groups_. You should
see a popup titled _Configure - All Age Groups_.

![title](/ocpu/library/MedicMobileImpact/vaccine/images/AllAgeGroups.png)

The defaults should be fine here. Make sure that _First year_ is `r
first.anc.year` and that _Display Interval_ is Single year.

Click _OK_.

You should now see a tab titled 'Population by age and sex' with a
population table in it. There seems to be a bug in this Spectrum
version where even if Single year is selected ages are given in five
year increments. When this bug is fixed, the 0-1 age group should be
used.

![title](/ocpu/library/MedicMobileImpact/vaccine/images/PopByAgeAndSex.png)

**What is the number in the upper left box (`r first.anc.year` Total 0-4`)?**

```{r}
n.child.zero_to_four <- 7334114
```

What we are actually interested in is the children age 0-1. Until
Spectrum provides this information directly, we can approximate by
dividing the 0-4 group by 5. This has obvious inaccuracies; if a
better method of obtaining this population size is available it should
be used.

```{r echo=FALSE}
n.child.infant <- n.child.zero_to_four / 5
```

Children 0-1:

*`r n.child.infant`*

# Scale up Vaccines in LiST

Make sure you’re in the _Modules_ tab.  Select the _LiST_ module.

Select _Coverage_.  In the dialog, select the _Vaccines_ tab.  You’ll see nationally averaged coverage rates already populated in the table.  Look at the year in the table corresponding to `r first.anc.year`.  

![title](/ocpu/library/MedicMobileImpact/vaccine/images/VaccineTab.png)

**What is the coverage rate shown for Polio in `r first.anc.year`?**

```{r}
baseline.polio.coverage.rate <- 88.0
```

**What is the coverage rate shown for DTP in `r first.anc.year`?**

```{r}
baseline.dtp.coverage.rate <- 0.0
```

**What is the coverage rate shown for Measles in `r first.anc.year`?**

```{r}
baseline.measles.coverage.rate <- 93.0
```

In order to compute the new vaccine rates after the intervention, we'll assume that all children in the country not affected by the intervention are subject to the national average rate, and that all children in the intervention have a 100% coverage rate for a given vaccine.

To compute this we use the formula

$$
\frac{\text{default coverage rate} \times (N\text{ all 0-1 children} - N\text{ children covered by this program}) + N\text{ children covered by this program}}{N\text{ 0-1 children}},
$$

```{r echo=FALSE}
new.polio.coverage.rate <- min(1,(baseline.polio.coverage.rate/100*(n.child.infant-min(0,n.child.covered )) + n.child.covered )/n.child.infant)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
new.dtp.coverage.rate <- min(1,(baseline.dtp.coverage.rate/100*(n.child.infant-min(0,n.child.covered )) + n.child.covered )/n.child.infant)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
new.measles.coverage.rate <- min(1,(baseline.measles.coverage.rate/100*(n.child.infant-min(0,n.child.covered )) + n.child.covered )/n.child.infant)
```

New Polio Coverage Rate:

*`r sprintf("%.1f",new.polio.coverage.rate*100)`*

New DTP Coverage Rate:

*`r sprintf("%.1f",new.dtp.coverage.rate*100)`*

New Measles Coverage Rate:

*`r sprintf("%.1f",new.measles.coverage.rate*100)`*

Now update the coverage rate for those three vaccines in `r
first.anc.year`. To do so click the appropriate box and update the
value. To update DPT you may need to uncheck the _Pentavalent--
automatically calculate components_ checkbox.

![title](/ocpu/library/MedicMobileImpact/vaccine/images/VaccineTabUpdated.png)

Click _Ok_ to save changes and exit the dialog.

Now to compute lives saved.  Click _Results &rarr; Child &rarr;
Additional deaths prevented in children under five years of age
relative to impact year_.  In the dialog, select _Table_ and hit _Ok_.
You should see a table like this.

![title](/ocpu/library/MedicMobileImpact/vaccine/images/ChildrenSaved.png)

Zero or negative numbers mean you haven't prevented any deaths.
Positive numbers tell you how many lives you've saved per year.  The
totals across all age groups appear in the first line of the table.
