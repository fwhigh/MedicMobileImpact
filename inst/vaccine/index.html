Medic Mobile Vaccine Effectiveness Worksheet
============================================

## Synopsis

The purpose of this worksheet is to estimate the effectiveness of
childhood vaccination programs on a population.

## Requirements

This worksheet requires you to run Spectrum.  Spectrum is a Windows
program, but you can run it on a Mac. Please see the DataKind How To
document for instructions.

## Software Versions Tested

* Mac OS X Mavericks
* Wine 1.6.1, packaged with WineBottler
* Spectrum 4.7, includes LiST, DemProj and AIM
* RStudio 0.98 with knitr 1.5

## Instructions

This is a [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/)
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) document.
knitr is an R package that allows you decorate R code with formatted
text for ease of reading.  knitr allows you to insert R source code
in-line with the simple text formatting.  R code is enclosed in sets
of one or three back-quotes.  knitr compiles the document into HTML by
interpeting the markdown as HTML elements, evaluating the R source
code and inserting it directly into the HTML.  You are left with a
readable document that contains dynamically evaluated R code.

For those wishing to complete the worksheet, we have streamlined the
process using [OpenCPU](https://www.opencpu.org/) and
[markdownapp](https://github.com/opencpu/markdownapp), which provides
an editor in your web browser and compiles the markdown dynamically
into a separate frame.

Note that the worksheet resets to default values when you refresh the
page.  If you need to save your worksheet in in your browswer, click
on the compiled markdown document in the right-hand frame in your
browser, select all (command-a on a Mac), and print (command-p on a
Mac).

When doing the worksheet, **read this document carefully and in
order.** You will read descriptive text that provides some context on
what you are undertaking, and every once in a while you will be asked
to enter data into this worksheet or copy a derived quantity from this
worksheet into Spectrum.

## Preparation

What is the name of the country?

**Enter the value in the markdown document.**

```{r}
country.name <- "Kenya"
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
this.year <- as.POSIXlt(Sys.Date())
this.year$year <- this.year$year + 1
first.anc.year <- format(as.Date(this.year),"%Y")
```

How many children will the program serve in `r first.anc.year`?

**Enter the value in the markdown document.**

```{r}
n.child.covered <- 5000
```

You are embarking on vaccine projection for `r country.name`. The year
you want to model an increase in coverage is `r first.anc.year`.

## Initialize Spectrum

Launch Spectrum.  (If this is your first time, proceed to the next
step now.  If this is not your first time, make sure all your previous
projection are closed: in the _Home_ tab, select _Close &rarr; All
Projections_.)

Click _New_ or _New projection_.

![title](/ocpu/library/MedicMobileImpact/images/Spectrum_first_screen.png)

In the _New_ dialog, under “Set a name...”, set the name for this
projection.  Make it descriptive of the country, locale and
intervention.

Under “Set year boundaries...”, enter a first year that is at least a
full year before the start of the intervention.

Set the final year to 10 years after the start year.

In the “Activate modules for use in your projection” area, check the
following three boxes.

1. _Demographic Projection (DemProj)_
1. _AIDS (AIM)_
1. _Lives Saved Tool (LiST)_

In the “Select a country from which to retrieve demographic and other
default data”, click _Country data_ and select 
`r country.name`.  Make sure DemProj, AIM, and LiST are checked.

Click _Ok_. 

## Determine Children in Country

Click on the _Modules_ tab in the main window.

Click on the _DemProj_ module.

Select _Results &rarr; Age Groups &rarr; All Age Groups_. You should
see a popup titled _Configure - All Age Groups_.

![title](/ocpu/library/MedicMobileImpact/images/AllAgeGroups.png)

The defaults should be fine here. Make sure that _First year_ is 
`r first.anc.year` and that _Display Interval_ is Single year.

Click _OK_.

You should now see a tab titled 'Population by age and sex' with a
population table in it. There seems to be a bug in this Spectrum
version where even if Single year is selected ages are given in five
year increments. When this bug is fixed, the 0-1 age group should be
used.

![title](/ocpu/library/MedicMobileImpact/images/PopByAgeAndSex.png)

What is the number in the upper left box (`r first.anc.year` Total 0-4`)?

**Enter the value in the markdown document.**

```{r}
n.child.zero_to_four <- 7334114
```

What we are actually interested in is the children age 0-1. Until
Spectrum provides this information directly, we can approximate by
dividing the 0-4 group by 5. This has obvious inaccuracies; if a
better method of obtaining this population size is available it should
be used.

```{r echo=FALSE}
n.child.infant <- n.child.zero_to_four / 5
```

Children 0-1:

*`r n.child.infant`*

## Scale up Vaccines in LiST

Make sure you’re in the _Modules_ tab.  Select the _LiST_ module.

Select _Coverage_.  In the dialog, select the _Vaccines_ tab.  You’ll
see nationally averaged coverage rates already populated in the table.
Look at the year in the table corresponding to `r first.anc.year`.

![title](/ocpu/library/MedicMobileImpact/images/VaccineTab.png)

What is the coverage rate shown for Polio in `r first.anc.year`?

**Enter the value in the markdown document.**

```{r}
baseline.polio.coverage.rate <- 88.0
```

What is the coverage rate shown for DPT in `r first.anc.year`?

**Enter the value in the markdown document.**

```{r}
baseline.dpt.coverage.rate <- 0.0
```

What is the coverage rate shown for Measles in `r first.anc.year`?

**Enter the value in the markdown document.**

```{r}
baseline.measles.coverage.rate <- 93.0
```

In order to compute the new vaccine rates after the intervention, we
will assume that all children in the country not affected by the
intervention are subject to the national average rate, and that all
children in the intervention have a 100% coverage rate for a given
vaccine.

To compute this we use the formula

$$
\frac{\text{default coverage rate} \times (N\text{ all 0-1 children} - N\text{ children covered by this program}) + N\text{ children covered by this program}}{N\text{ 0-1 children}},
$$

```{r echo=FALSE}
new.polio.coverage.rate <- min(1,(baseline.polio.coverage.rate/100*(n.child.infant-min(0,n.child.covered )) + n.child.covered )/n.child.infant)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
new.dpt.coverage.rate <- min(1,(baseline.dpt.coverage.rate/100*(n.child.infant-min(0,n.child.covered )) + n.child.covered )/n.child.infant)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
new.measles.coverage.rate <- min(1,(baseline.measles.coverage.rate/100*(n.child.infant-min(0,n.child.covered )) + n.child.covered )/n.child.infant)
```

New Polio Coverage Rate:

*`r sprintf("%.1f",new.polio.coverage.rate*100)`*

New DPT Coverage Rate:

*`r sprintf("%.1f",new.dpt.coverage.rate*100)`*

New Measles Coverage Rate:

*`r sprintf("%.1f",new.measles.coverage.rate*100)`*

Now update the coverage rate for those three vaccines in `r first.anc.year`. 
To do so click the appropriate box and update the
value. To update DPT you may need to uncheck the _Pentavalent--
automatically calculate components_ checkbox.

![title](/ocpu/library/MedicMobileImpact/images/VaccineTabUpdated.png)

Click _Ok_ to save changes and exit the dialog.

Now to compute lives saved.  Click _Results &rarr; Child &rarr;
Additional deaths prevented in children under five years of age by
intervention relative to impact year_.  In the dialog, select _Table_
and hit _Ok_.  You should see a table like this.

![title](/ocpu/library/MedicMobileImpact/images/VaccineLivesSavedByIntervention.png)

Add the results under the _Vaccine_ subheading together to estimate
lives saved from the vaccine coverage increase.

Enter the values from Spectrum into the [Vaccine Impact Google
Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GmnXEAV0ol38_gj90GpHLsryquQOkrt1_D6JKqI1gIM/edit?usp=sharing)

Zero or negative numbers mean you have not prevented any deaths.
Positive numbers tell you how many lives you have saved per year.

## Explore the relative effectiveness of vaccines

You can explore the relative effectiveness of interventions using
LiST's _Interventions_ tool.  See the ANC worksheet for a brief
discussion.
