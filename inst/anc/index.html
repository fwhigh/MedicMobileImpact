<div id="editor">Medic Mobile ANC Effectiveness Worksheet
========================================

## Synopsis

The purpose of this worksheet is to estimate the effectiveness of ANC
treatment on a population.

## Requirements

This worksheet requires you to run Spectrum.  Spectrum is a Windows
program, but you can run it on a Mac. Please see the DataKind How To
document for instructions.

## Software Versions Tested

* Mac OS X Mavericks
* Wine 1.6.1, packaged with WineBottler
* Spectrum 4.7, includes LiST, DemProj and AIM
* RStudio 0.98, R 3.0.1, knitr 1.5, Markdownapp for OpenCPU 1.2.2

## Glossary

ANC:  Antenatal care

CBR:  Crude birth rate

LiST: Lives Saved Tool

## Instructions

This is a [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/)
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) document.
knitr is an R package that allows you decorate R code with formatted
text for ease of reading.  knitr allows you to insert R source code
in-line with the simple text formatting.  R code is enclosed in sets
of one or three back-quotes.  knitr compiles the document into HTML by
interpeting the markdown as HTML elements, evaluating the R source
code and inserting it directly into the HTML.  You are left with a
readable document that contains dynamically evaluated R code.

For those wishing to complete the worksheet, we have streamlined the
process using [OpenCPU](https://www.opencpu.org/) and
[markdownapp](https://github.com/opencpu/markdownapp), which provides
an editor in your web browser and compiles the markdown dynamically
into a separate frame.

Note that the worksheet resets to default values when you refresh the
page.  If you need to save your worksheet in in your browswer, click
on the compiled markdown document in the right-hand frame in your
browser, select all (command-a on a Mac), and print (command-p on a
Mac).

When doing the worksheet, **read this document carefully and in
order.** You will read descriptive text that provides some context on
what you are undertaking, and every once in a while you will be asked
to enter data into this worksheet or copy a derived quantity from this
worksheet into Spectrum.

## Preparation

What is the name of the country?  

**Enter the value in the markdown document.**

```{r}
country.name <- "Nigeria"
```

Provide a recent estimate of the population of `r country.name`.  This
can be any estimate from the last few years.

**Enter the value in the markdown document.**

```{r}
country.population <- 168.8e6
```

What is the year of this estimate?

**Enter the value in the markdown document.**

```{r}
country.population.year <- 2012
```

What is the name of the catchment?  _If you do not want to scale down
the population to a subnation catchment area, then just enter the
country name again._

**Enter the value in the markdown document.**

```{r}
catchment.name <- "Lagos"
```

What is the population of `r catchment.name` around 
`r country.population.year`?  _If you do not want to scale down the
population to a subnation catchment area, then just enter the
country's population again._

**Enter the value in the markdown document.**

```{r}
catchment.population <- 12e6
```

What year would you like to do a projection for?  This must be next
year or beyond; it cannot be this year.

```{r}
first.anc.year <- 2015
```

How many women will your program serve in `r first.anc.year`?

**Enter the value in the markdown document.**

```{r}
n.women.covered <- 100000
```

## Do a national projection for `r country.name`

Launch Spectrum.  (If this is your first time, proceed to the next
step now.  If this is not your first time, make sure all your previous
projection are closed: in the _Home_ tab, select _Close &rarr; All
Projections_.)

Click _New_ or _New projection_.

![title](/ocpu/library/MedicMobileImpact/images/Spectrum_first_screen.png)

```{r echo=FALSE}
national.filename <- sprintf("%s ANC.PNJ",country.name)
```

In the _New_ dialog, under “Set a name...”, set the name for this
projection to 
**`r national.filename`**.

Under “Set year boundaries...”, 
* **enter `r country.population.year` as the first year**
* **enter `r first.anc.year` or any year afterward as the final year**.

In the “Activate modules for use in your projection” area, check the
following three boxes.

1. _Demographic Projection (DemProj)_
1. _AIDS (AIM)_
1. _Lives Saved Tool (LiST)_

In the “Select a country from which to retrieve demographic and other
default data”, click _Country data_ and select the country
corresponding to 1b.  Make sure DemProj, AIM, and LiST are checked
(they should already be).

Hit _Ok_.

Click _Modules &rarr; DemProj &rarr; Results &rarr; Population &rarr;
Total population_.  Accept the defaults by clicking _Ok_ in the dialog.
You will see a graph of the projected population from 
`r country.population.year` to your final projection year.  

Click _Home &rarr; Save_.

## OPTIONAL: Do a subnational projection for `r catchment.name`

_If you are not doing an ANC projection for a subnational catchment,
then skip this section._

In the _Home_ tab, click Click _New_.

```{r echo=FALSE}
catchment.filename <- sprintf("%s %s ANC.PNJ",country.name,catchment.name)
```

In the _New_ dialog, under “Set a name...”, set the name for this
projection to 
**`r catchment.filename`**.

Under “Set year boundaries...”, 
* **enter `r country.population.year` as the first year**
* **enter the final year you entered above for the national projection**.

In the “Activate modules for use in your projection” area, check the
following three boxes.

1. _Demographic Projection (DemProj)_
1. _AIDS (AIM)_
1. _Lives Saved Tool (LiST)_

In the “Select a country from which to retrieve demographic and other
default data”, click _Country data_ and select 
`r country.name`.  Make sure DemProj, AIM, and LiST are checked.

Now check the box for _Subnational projection_, write `r catchment.name`.

Hit _Ok_.  

![title](/ocpu/library/MedicMobileImpact/images/New_Spectrum_version_creation_dialog.png)

In the dialog that opens ("Subnational projection setup"), click
_Country projection_, and select the national projection file you
saved earlier, **`r national.filename`**.

In the field "Enter the percent of `r country.name`'s population that
is part of...", find the column for `r country.population.year`.
**For all years from `r country.population.year` to 
the final projection year, enter 
`r sprintf("%.1f",catchment.population/country.population*100)`**.

Hit _Ok_.  

## Do a population and birth rate projection

Click _Modules &rarr; DemProj &rarr; Results &rarr; Population &rarr;
Total population_. Accept the defaults by clicking _Ok_ in the dialog.
You will see a graph of the projected population from 
`r country.population.year` to the final projection year.  Check that the 
`r country.name` `r catchment.name`
population in 
`r country.population.year`
is about 
`r catchment.population`.

Click on _Results &rarr; Vital Events &rarr; Crude Birth Rate_.  Check
_Table plus_ chart.  Click _Ok_.  You’ll see a projection of the crude
birth rate for your catchment from the year after your first year to
your final year.

![title](/ocpu/library/MedicMobileImpact/images/Crude_Birth_Rate_Projection.png)

This is the number of births per 1000 people.  What is the CBR for
`r first.anc.year`?

**Enter the value in the markdown document.**

```{r}
spectrum.cbr.first.anc.year <- 38.77
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
n.pregnant.women.first.anc.year <- 
  spectrum.cbr.first.anc.year/1000*catchment.population
```

Given this value, the estimated number of pregnant women in 
`r catchment.name` in `r first.anc.year` is 
`r sprintf("%.0f",n.pregnant.women.first.anc.year)`.

## Scale up ANC in LiST

Make sure you’re in the _Modules_ tab.  Select the _LiST_ module.

Select _Coverage_.  In the dialog, select the _Pregnancy_ tab.  You’ll
see nationally averaged coverage rates already populated in the table.
Look at the "Antenatal care" row of the table.  What is the coverage
rate shown for `r first.anc.year`?

**Enter the value in the markdown document.**

```{r}
baseline.anc.coverage.rate <- 44.8
```

By default, LiST is assuming that 
`r sprintf("%.f",baseline.anc.coverage.rate/100*n.pregnant.women.first.anc.year)`
out of 
`r sprintf("%.f",n.pregnant.women.first.anc.year)` pregnant
women are being treated with antenatal care.  This coverage rate is
equal to the national coverage rate by default.

**Enter the following value into Spectrum into the "Antenatal care"
row in all columns from `r first.anc.year` and beyond in Spectrum.**

```{r echo=FALSE}
new.anc.coverage.rate <- 
  min(1,(baseline.anc.coverage.rate/100*(n.pregnant.women.first.anc.year-min(0,n.women.covered)) 
   + n.women.covered)/n.pregnant.women.first.anc.year)
```

*`r sprintf("%.1f",new.anc.coverage.rate*100)`*

This number is computed as

$$
\frac{\text{default coverage rate} \times (N\text{ pregnant women} - N\text{ women covered by this program}) + N\text{ women covered by this program}}{N\text{ pregnant women}},
$$

imposing the rule that$N\text{ women covered by this program} \leq N\text{ pregnant women}.$

Click _Ok_ to save changes and exit the dialog.

## Project lives saved

Now to compute lives saved.  Click _Results &rarr; Neonatal &rarr;
Additional deaths prevented in children under one month of age by
intervention relative to impact year_.  In the dialog, select _Table_
and hit _Ok_.

In the table you will see an estimate of the number of lives saved for
`r catchment.name` in `r first.anc.year`, disaggregated by
intervention.  Zero or negative numbers mean the full suite of
interventions have not prevented any deaths.  Positive numbers tell
you how many lives you will potentially affect.  Focus only on those
interventions that fall under ANC, and record those numbers into the
[ANC Impact Google
Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdJjavgBQ9Q5ZU7ODK0jO0VvNO24V2TCifoAj8DEkEc/edit?usp=sharing).

You can repeat the lives saved estimates for other population segments.

* Mothers: _Results &rarr; Maternal &rarr; Additional maternal deaths
by intervention prevented relative to impact year_.

* Stillbirths: _Results &rarr; Maternal &rarr; Additional stillbirths
prevented relative to impact year_.

You could also do a projection for "five year old children and
younger": _Results &rarr; Child &rarr; Additional deaths prevented in
children under five years of age by intervention relative to impact
year_.  But this population segment is less relevant to ANC treatment
efficacy studies than the other segments in LiST.

Enter the number of lives saved by your ANC increases from Spectrum
into the [ANC Impact Google
Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdJjavgBQ9Q5ZU7ODK0jO0VvNO24V2TCifoAj8DEkEc/edit?usp=sharing).

## Explore the relative effectiveness of ANC

In the _LiST_ module, click _Effectiveness_ &rarr; Effectiveness of
interventions (maternal)_. You will see numbers between 0 and 1 in a
series of tables, or empty tables.  These numbers are "effectiveness",
which is defined as "the fraction of deaths due to a specific cause
that are reduced by the intervention", and "affected fraction", which
is "the fraction of deaths due to a specific cause that are
potentially able to be impacted by a specific intervention".
"Effectiveness" tells you how many deaths a particular intervention
prevented for a particular segment (maternal, in this example),
divided by the total number of deaths in the segment. "Affected
fraction" tells you how many that intervention has reached, again by
segment.

As before, you can repeat this exercise for each segment.

* One month old children and younger: _Effectiveness &rarr;
Effectiveness of interventions (<1 month)_.

* Stillbirths: _Effectiveness &rarr;
Effectiveness of interventions (stillbirths)_.

Again, looking at effectiveness for 1-59 month children is optional.
